															<h2>Total productive Maintenance : A case study in Manufacturing Industry</h2>
															<p >Abstract : Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a people-intensive, preventive maintenance system for maximizing equipment effectiveness in the enterprise. The concept of TPM was originally suggested by Nakajima (1988) who proposed overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) as a metric for evaluating the progress of TPM, which is interpreted as the multiplication of availability, performance and quality. This paper aims to study and investigate the implementation of TPM to improve the OEE of the bull gear shop plant in manufacturing enterprises. In todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s industrial scenario huge losses occur in the manufacturing shop floor. These losses are due to operators, maintenance personal, process, tooling problems and non-availability of components in time etc. The quality related wastes are of significant importance as they matter the company in terms of time, material and the hard earned reputation of the company. There are also other invisible losses like operating the machines below the rated speed, start up loss, break down of the machines and bottle necks in process. Zero oriented concepts such as zero tolerance for losses, defects, break down and zero accidents are becoming a pre-requisite in the manufacturing and assembly industry. In this situation, a TPM is the answer to resolve the above said problems which helps in benefitting the growth prospects of any organization.

													<h2>Multi-attribute and Multi-criteria Decision Making Model for technology selection using fuzzy logic</h2>
													<p >Abstract: The problem of identification and elimination of useful technology is a multi-attribute, multi-valued problem which involves both tangible and intangible factors. To select the best useful technology that achieves most of the company requirements ,it is essential to use an appropriate selection approach that takes into consideration the different. quantitative and qualitative parameters of industry objectives and technology benefits. In this paper,FMCDM (Fuzzy-based MultAttribute and Multi-criteria decision Method ) is described and explained .

													<h2>Incidence Handling & Response System</h2>
													<p >Abstract:A computer network can be attacked in a number of ways. The security-related threats have become not only numerous but also diverse and they may also come in the form of blended attacks. it becomes difficult for any security system to block all types of attacks. this gives rise to the need of an incidence handling capability which is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited and restoring the computing services. incidence response has always been an important aspect of information security but it is often overlooked by security administrators. in this paper, we propose an automated system which will handle the security threats and make the computer network capable enough to withstand any kind of attack. we also present the state-of-the-art technology in computer, network and software which is required to build such a system.

													<h2>Algorithm to access Office Files on Mobile Phones.</h2>
													<p >Abstract: Almost all mobile phones available in the market support the programming language Java i.e. J2ME, but majority of these phones do not support the following file formats - .doc, .docx, .ppt and .rtf. These phones allow only .txt files to be viewed. Presently there is no software that allows java enabled phones to view these files. So users have to convert these files to .txt and in the case of .ppt, they have to convert it into an image. Since these files are important for many users, this causes a lot of inconvenience to them. In this paper we propose a Ã¢â‚¬ËœMobile OfficeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ application which will make it possible for all java enabled mobile phone users to view the above mentioned files. Moreover, this will opiate the need to convert a .doc, .docx or .rtf file to .txt to be able to view them on the phone. We also describe the approach about how the above file formats can be accessed. This approach will enable these files to be accessed in low end java enabled devices with relative ease.

													<h2>ANFIS based Spam Filtering Model for Social Networking Websites.</h2>
													<p >Abstract: Spam is flooding the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. There are various types of spam such as email spam, forum spam, online classified ads spam, attachment spam, social networking spam etc. For the purpose of this paper, we would like to concentrate more on social networking spam (SNS). SNS is when unwanted messages or posts are sent to people in bulk, or when a single click of a seemingly harmless link reposts the link on other profiles, thus spreading the spam like a virus. We plan to use an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that incorporates the advantages of both the neural networking concepts and fuzzy logic to identify the spam messages on such websites.</p>

													<h2>Smartcard based Android Application for Public Transport Ticketing System.</h2>
													<p >Abstract: The large amount of growth in India's population has increased the demand on the transport systems. In the areas of public transport, it has become essential to consider effective technologies that will ease the system of transport. This paper presents the design of a public transport ticketing system that harnesses the functionality of the existing electronic smart cards into an Android application. This application aims to relate the Man Machine Interaction (MMI) principles of functionality, usability, simplicity, visibility, affordance and consistency for enhancing the experience of ticketing for the public transport commuters in India.

													<h2>Neuro-Analytical Hierarchy Process (NAHP)  Approach for Selecting ERP Technologies in a Ongoing Project Settings</h2>
													<p >Abstract: This paper provides a solution for ERP software selection & elimination. ERP is a way to integrate data and processes of an organization into a centralized system that aims to have a single software solution where the information needed for decision making is shared across different departments. The selection or elimination of technology is a multi-criteria, multi-attribute, decision making problem, which involves both tangible and intangible factors that can be solved by Neuro-Analytical Hierarchy Process (NAHP). NAHP, which is based on Neural Networks, is a completely new approach towards solving this problem. We make a pair wise comparison of software (ERP) which helps in determining its relative ability to reach the decision goal. Thus NAHP automates the decision making process by justifying 'Why to select one technology?' and 'Why to eliminate one technology?' which helps in benefiting the growth prospects of any organization.</p>

													<h2>Zip it Up SMS :- A Path breaking Technology Model in the field of Mobile Messaging</h2>
	                        <p >Abstract: Current text messaging protocols over the world allow a rigid limit of 160 characters per SMS, using the default messaging system of the mobile. However this limit is often found to be too less under ordinary circumstances and to communicate effectively, often a concatenated message needs to be sent. This, coupled with exorbitant messaging rates adds to the reduced effectiveness and decrease in potential users of the Short Messaging Service. However, in Zip It Up SMS (ZIUS), we have developed our own algorithm, and been successful in compressing more data into the same message. Now every SMS can carry up to an average-best case of 250 characters, which can bring about a change in standards and prove to be a massive boost to the mobile industry.</p>

													<h2>Total Productive Maintenance â€“Accelerating OEE in a Manufacturing Industry leveraging pervasive technologies</h2>
	                        <p >Abstract: Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a people-intensive, preventive maintenance system for maximizing equipment effectiveness in the enterprise. The concept of TPM was originally suggested by Nakajima (1988) who proposed overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) as a metric for evaluating the progress of TPM, which is interpreted as the multiplication of availability, performance and quality. This paper aims to study and investigate the implementation of a TPM to improve the OEE in manufacturing enterprises. In today's industrial scenario huge losses occur in the manufacturing shop floor. These losses are due to operators, maintenance personal, process, tooling problems and non-availability of components in time etc. The quality related waste are of significant importance as they matter the company in terms of time, material and the hard earned reputation of the company. There are also other invisible losses like operating the machines below the rated speed, start up loss, break down of the machines and bottle necks in process. Zero oriented concepts such as zero tolerance for losses, defects, break down and zero accidents are becoming a pre-requisite in the manufacturing and assembly industry. In this situation, a TPM is the answer to resolve the above said problems which helps in benefitting the growth prospects of any organization.</p>

													<h2>Energy Conservation using Face Detection</h2>
	                        <p >Abstract: Computerized Face Detection, is concerned with the difficult task of converting a video signal of a person to written text. It has several applications like face recognition, simultaneous multiple face processing, biometrics, security, video surveillance, human computer interface, image database management, digital cameras use face detection for autofocus, selecting regions of interest in photo slideshows that use a panand- scale and The Present Paper deals with energy conservation using face detection. Automating the process to a computer requires the use of various image processing techniques. There are various methods that can be used for Face Detection such as Contour tracking methods, Template matching, Controlled background, Model based, Motion based and color based. Basically, the video of the subject are converted into images are further selected manually for processing. However, several factors like poor illumination, movement of face, viewpoint-dependent Physical appearance, Acquisition geometry, Imaging conditions, Compression artifacts makes Face detection difficult. This paper reports an algorithm for conservation of energy using face detection for various devices. The present paper suggests Energy Conservation can be done by Detecting the Face and reducing the brightness of complete image and then adjusting the brightness of the particular area of an image where the face is located using histogram equalization.</p>

													<h2>Demonstrating Creation of an Empirical Formula from the First Principle: A Case Study in Manufacturing Industries</h2>
	                        <p >Abstract: Small manufacturing industries based on its unit numbers and the number of involved labors , has the potential to play an important role in IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Economy. Each industry applying the different process of technology acquisition which has the direct impact on cost variable. Each industry has a set of attributes which influences the result of their investments .These success criteria will differ from company to company and hence there is a need to study, to identify and to evaluate such attributes in order to measure the degree of success to be achieved. This paper demonstrates the use of T-distribution model to create an empirical formula from the first principle for Labor cost and the relationship is thus derived between three variables IATC , EATC and LC namely Intrinsic Acquisition Technology Cost and Extrinsic Acquisition Technology Cost and Labor cost respectively which is explained with the data assumed from the survey in manufacturing industry.</p>
