                    <p>Abstract : Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a people-intensive, preventive maintenance system for maximizing equipment effectiveness in the enterprise. The concept of TPM was originally suggested by Nakajima (1988) who proposed
                      overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) as a metric for evaluating the progress of TPM, which is interpreted as the multiplication of availability, performance and quality. This paper aims to study and investigate the implementation
                      of TPM to improve the OEE of the bull gear shop plant in manufacturing enterprises. In todayâ€™s industrial scenario huge losses occur in the manufacturing shop floor. These losses are due to operators, maintenance personal, process,
                      tooling problems and non-availability of components in time etc. The quality related wastes are of significant importance as they matter the company in terms of time, material and the hard earned reputation of the company. There
                      are also other invisible losses like operating the machines below the rated speed, start up loss, break down of the machines and bottle necks in process. Zero oriented concepts such as zero tolerance for losses, defects, break down
                      and zero accidents are becoming a pre-requisite in the manufacturing and assembly industry. In this situation, a TPM is the answer to resolve the above said problems which helps in benefitting the growth prospects of any organization.

                    <p>Abstract:A computer network can be attacked in a number of ways. The security-related threats have become not only numerous but also diverse and they may also come in the form of blended attacks. it becomes difficult for any security
                      system to block all types of attacks. this gives rise to the need of an incidence handling capability which is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited
                      and restoring the computing services. incidence response has always been an important aspect of information security but it is often overlooked by security administrators. in this paper, we propose an automated system which will
                      handle the security threats and make the computer network capable enough to withstand any kind of attack. we also present the state-of-the-art technology in computer, network and software which is required to build such a system.

                    <h3>Algorithm to access Office Files on Mobile Phones</h3>
                    <p>Abstract: Almost all mobile phones available in the market support the programming language Java i.e. J2ME, but majority of these phones do not support the following file formats - .doc, .docx, .ppt and .rtf. These phones allow only
                      .txt files to be viewed. Presently there is no software that allows java enabled phones to view these files. So users have to convert these files to .txt and in the case of .ppt, they have to convert it into an image. Since these
                      files are important for many users, this causes a lot of inconvenience to them. In this paper we propose a â€˜Mobile Officeâ€™ application which will make it possible for all java enabled mobile phone users to view the above mentioned
                      files. Moreover, this will opiate the need to convert a .doc, .docx or .rtf file to .txt to be able to view them on the phone. We also describe the approach about how the above file formats can be accessed. This approach will enable
                      these files to be accessed in low end java enabled devices with relative ease. Published in International Journal of Computer Application (IJCA),ISSN:0975 8887,March 2011.</p>

                    <p>Abstract: Spam is flooding the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. There are various types of spam such as email spam, forum spam,
                      online classified ads spam, attachment spam, social networking spam etc. For the purpose of this paper, we would like to concentrate more on social networking spam (SNS). SNS is when unwanted messages or posts are sent to people
                      in bulk, or when a single click of a seemingly harmless link reposts the link on other profiles, thus spreading the spam like a virus. We plan to use an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that incorporates the advantages
                      of both the neural networking concepts and fuzzy logic to identify the spam messages on such websites.</p>

                        <p>Abstract: This paper provides a solution for ERP software selection & elimination. ERP is a way to integrate data and processes of an organization into a centralized system that aims to have a single software solution where the
                          information needed for decision making is shared across different departments. The selection or elimination of technology is a multi-criteria, multi-attribute, decision making problem, which involves both tangible and intangible
                          factors that can be solved by Neuro-Analytical Hierarchy Process (NAHP). NAHP, which is based on Neural Networks, is a completely new approach towards solving this problem. We make a pair wise comparison of software (ERP) which
                          helps in determining its relative ability to reach the decision goal. Thus NAHP automates the decision making process by justifying 'Why to select one technology?' and 'Why to eliminate one technology?' which helps in benefiting
                          the growth prospects of any organization.</p>

                        <p>Abstract: Current text messaging protocols over the world allow a rigid limit of 160 characters per SMS, using the default messaging system of the mobile. However this limit is often found to be too less under ordinary circumstances
                          and to communicate effectively, often a concatenated message needs to be sent. This, coupled with exorbitant messaging rates adds to the reduced effectiveness and decrease in potential users of the Short Messaging Service. However,
                          in Zip It Up SMS (ZIUS), we have developed our own algorithm, and been successful in compressing more data into the same message. Now every SMS can carry up to an average-best case of 250 characters, which can bring about a change
                          in standards and prove to be a massive boost to the mobile industry.</p>

                          security, video surveillance, human computer interface, image database management, digital cameras use face detection for autofocus, selecting regions of interest in photo slideshows that use a panand- scale and The Present Paper
                          deals with energy conservation using face detection. Automating the process to a computer requires the use of various image processing techniques. There are various methods that can be used for Face Detection such as Contour
                          tracking methods, Template matching, Controlled background, Model based, Motion based and color based. Basically, the video of the subject are converted into images are further selected manually for processing. However, several
                          factors like poor illumination, movement of face, viewpoint-dependent Physical appearance, Acquisition geometry, Imaging conditions, Compression artifacts makes Face detection difficult. This paper reports an algorithm for conservation
                          of energy using face detection for various devices. The present paper suggests Energy Conservation can be done by Detecting the Face and reducing the brightness of complete image and then adjusting the brightness of the particular
                          area of an image where the face is located using histogram equalization.</p>

                        <h2>MIS for Knowledge Management in the organization</h2>
                        <p>Abstract: As we know , information is becoming an important corporate resource that must be captured, protected, preserved, and grown. Creating and using knowledge is not limited to information-based companies: it is necessary
                          for all organizations, regardless of industry sector. It's not enough to make good products; companies must make products that are better, less expensive to produce, and more desirable than those of competitors. Using corporate
                          and individual knowledge wisely will help companies do that. In the last few years, companies have downsized and flattened their organizations. Many of the employees who were laid off had been with the company for years. When
                          they walked out the door, they took experience, education, contacts, and information with them. The companies are finding out how important that human resource is to their success. And as companies continue to expand on a global
                          basis and increase their use of technology to connect workers, they have to devise methods of disseminating information quickly to as many people as possible. If an employee in Chicago has experience with a certain production
                          method, it would be silly not to share that information with employees in Singapore so that they don't reinvent the wheel. So as knowledge becomes a central productive and strategic asset, the success of the organization increasingly
                          depends on its ability to gather, produce, maintain, and disseminate knowledge. To understand the concept of knowledge management, think of knowledge as a resource just like buildings, production equipment, product designs, and
                          money. All these resources need to be systematically and actively managed. Bannari Amman Inst.of Technology, 2005.</p>

                        <p>Abstract: The security and value of a computer system is compromised whenever an intrusion occurs. Network-based attacks make it difficult for legitimate users to access various network services by purposely occupying or sabotaging
                          network resources and services. This can be done by sending large amounts of network traffic, exploiting well-known faults in networking services, and by overloading network hosts. Intrusion Detection attempts to detect computer
                          attacks by examining various data records observed in processes on the network and is split into two groups, anomaly detection systems and misuse detection systems. Anomaly detection is an attempt to search for malicious behavior
                          that deviates from established normal patterns. Misuse detection is used to identify intrusions that match known attack scenarios.This paper describe the working of various intrusion detection mechanism and its preventive methods.

                        <h2>Systolic Arrays and Recursion : A new approach for matrix multiplication</h2>
                        <p>Abstract: Systolic arrays are multidimensional arrays of processing elements. It is an arrangement of processors in an array where data flows synchronously across the array between neighbors, usually with different data flowing
                          in different directions. One of the many applications of systolic array structure is multiplication of matrices. Different types of matrix multiplication, for example band matrix and sparse matrix multiplication are studied.
                          Algorithms with different efficiencies are tested and researched to find the most efficient technique for the same. All these techniques are studied with respect to their implementation using systolic architecture. In this paper
                          we describe the different techniques that use iteration and propose a new and simpler method using recursion. National Conference on a Recent Advances in Computer Vision and Information Technology's, Government College of Technology,
