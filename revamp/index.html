                    <h3>Total productive Maintenance : A case study in Manufacturing Industry</h3>
                    <p>Abstract : Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a people-intensive, preventive maintenance system for maximizing equipment effectiveness in the enterprise. The concept of TPM was originally suggested by Nakajima (1988) who proposed
                      overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) as a metric for evaluating the progress of TPM, which is interpreted as the multiplication of availability, performance and quality. This paper aims to study and investigate the implementation
                      of TPM to improve the OEE of the bull gear shop plant in manufacturing enterprises. In todayâ€™s industrial scenario huge losses occur in the manufacturing shop floor. These losses are due to operators, maintenance personal, process,
                      tooling problems and non-availability of components in time etc. The quality related wastes are of significant importance as they matter the company in terms of time, material and the hard earned reputation of the company. There
                      are also other invisible losses like operating the machines below the rated speed, start up loss, break down of the machines and bottle necks in process. Zero oriented concepts such as zero tolerance for losses, defects, break down
                      and zero accidents are becoming a pre-requisite in the manufacturing and assembly industry. In this situation, a TPM is the answer to resolve the above said problems which helps in benefitting the growth prospects of any organization.

                    <p>Abstract:A computer network can be attacked in a number of ways. The security-related threats have become not only numerous but also diverse and they may also come in the form of blended attacks. it becomes difficult for any security
                      system to block all types of attacks. this gives rise to the need of an incidence handling capability which is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited
                      and restoring the computing services. incidence response has always been an important aspect of information security but it is often overlooked by security administrators. in this paper, we propose an automated system which will
                      handle the security threats and make the computer network capable enough to withstand any kind of attack. we also present the state-of-the-art technology in computer, network and software which is required to build such a system.

                    <h3>Algorithm to access Office Files on Mobile Phones</h3>
                    <p>Abstract: Almost all mobile phones available in the market support the programming language Java i.e. J2ME, but majority of these phones do not support the following file formats - .doc, .docx, .ppt and .rtf. These phones allow only
                      .txt files to be viewed. Presently there is no software that allows java enabled phones to view these files. So users have to convert these files to .txt and in the case of .ppt, they have to convert it into an image. Since these
                      files are important for many users, this causes a lot of inconvenience to them. In this paper we propose a â€˜Mobile Officeâ€™ application which will make it possible for all java enabled mobile phone users to view the above mentioned
                      files. Moreover, this will opiate the need to convert a .doc, .docx or .rtf file to .txt to be able to view them on the phone. We also describe the approach about how the above file formats can be accessed. This approach will enable
                      these files to be accessed in low end java enabled devices with relative ease. Published in International Journal of Computer Application (IJCA),ISSN:0975 8887,March 2011.</p>

                    <h3>ANFIS based Spam Filtering Model for Social Networking Websites.</h3>
                    <p>Abstract: Spam is flooding the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. There are various types of spam such as email spam, forum spam,
                      online classified ads spam, attachment spam, social networking spam etc. For the purpose of this paper, we would like to concentrate more on social networking spam (SNS). SNS is when unwanted messages or posts are sent to people
                      in bulk, or when a single click of a seemingly harmless link reposts the link on other profiles, thus spreading the spam like a virus. We plan to use an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that incorporates the advantages
                      of both the neural networking concepts and fuzzy logic to identify the spam messages on such websites.</p>

                    <h3>Fuzzy neural model (FNM) for selecting ERP Technologies in a ongoing project settings</h3>
                    <p>The aim of this research work is to provides a solution for ERP software selection & elimination. ERP is a way to integrate data and processes of an organization into a centralized system that aims to have a single software solution
                      where the information needed for decision making is shared across different departments. The selection or elimination of technology is a multi-criteria, multi-attribute, decision making problem, which involves both tangible and intangible
                      factors, that can be solved by Fuzzy-Neural model (FNM). which is based on Neural Networks, is a new approach towards solving this problem. We trained the system to make a pair wise comparison of software (ERP) which helps in determining
                      its relative ability to reach the decision goal. Thus FNM Model automates the decision making process by justifying 'Why to select one technology?' and 'Why to eliminate one technology?', which helps in benefitting the growth prospects
                      of any organization. </p>

                    <h3>An Advanced Technology Selection Model using Neuro Fuzzy Algorithm for Electronic Toll Collection System</h3>
                    <p>Selecting an optimum advanced technology system for an organization is one of the most crucial issues in any industry. Any technology system which makes business process more efficient and business management more simplified is one
                      of the important Information System (IS) to the organization. The comprehensive framework is a three-phase approach which introduces two main ideas, one is the adopting of the McCall software quality model which is extracted from
                      technology management essentials, and use the factors of McCall software quality model to be some of the technology selection criteria. Another major point is implementing and proposing a model based on this research using Neuro-Fuzzy
                      algorithm to evaluate advance technology selection. This paper includes the concept of a new multi attribute selection process which combines both the Fuzzy logic (linguistic) and Neural network (integral valuation) methodology to
                      evaluate or estimate a technology for Electronic Toll Collection System. Managers will be able to use this model for selecting a new technology in to their organization.</p>

                    <p>This paper propose an efficient recommender system using collaborative filtering mechanism with kseparability approach for web based marketing. We follows the collaborative recommender method in which a user rating is aggregation of
                      various characters using matrix but dataset becomes very noisy and difficult to separate. So, the K-Separability approach extends linear separability of data clusters into k>2 segments on the discriminating hyperplane. It can be
                      implemented by single layer or 2-layer perceptron. K-Separability is able to uncover complex statistical dependencies i.e. positive or negative. Finally, We don’t need to filter the neighborhood of the target filter as other systems.
                      All neighborhoods are considered and extremely useful in case of sparse dataset.</p>

                    <p>Cloud computing is a rising technology which enables convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Mobile cloud computing is the availability of cloud computing services in a mobile ecosystem.
                      Mobile cloud computing shares with cloud computing the notion that services is provided by a cloud and accessed through mobile platforms. The paper aims to describe an online mobile cloud based compiler which helps to reduce the
                      problems of portability and storage space and resource constraints by making use of the concept of mobile cloud computing. The ability to use compiler application on mobile devices allows a programmer to get easy access of the code
                      and provides most convenient tool to compile the code and remove the errors. Moreover, a mobile cloud based compiler can be used remotely throughout any network connection (WI-FI/ GPRS) on any Smartphone. Thus, avoiding installation
                      of compilers on computers and reducing the dependency on computers to write and execute programs. </p>

                    <p>Criminalization may be a general development that has significantly extended in previous few years. In order, to create the activity of the work businesses easy, use of technology is important. Crime investigation analysis is a section
                      records in data mining plays a crucial role in terms of predicting and learning the criminals. In our paper, we've got planned an incorporated version for physical crime as well as cybercrime analysis. Our approach uses data mining
                      techniques for crime detection and criminal identity for physical crimes and digitized forensic tools (DFT) for evaluating cybercrimes. The presented tool named as Comparative Digital Forensic Process tool (CDFPT) is entirely based
                      on digital forensic model and its stages named as Comparative Digital Forensic Process Model (CDFPM). The primary step includes accepting the case details, categorizing the crime case as physical crime or cybercrime and sooner or
                      later storing the data in particular databases. For physical crime analysis we've used kmeans approach cluster set of rules to make crime clusters. The k-means method effects are a lot advantageous by the utilization of GMAPI generation.
                      This provides advanced and consumer-friendly visual-aid to k-means approach for tracing the region of the crime. we have applied KNN for criminal identification with the help of observing beyond crimes and finding similar ones that
                      suit this crime, if no past document is discovered then the new crime sample are introduced to the crime data-set. With the advancements of web, the network form has become much more complicated and attacking methods are further
                      more than that as well. For crime analysis we're detecting the attacks executed on host system through an outsider the usage of assorted digitized forensic tools to produce information security with the help of generating reports
                      for an event which could need any investigation. Our digitized technique aids the development of the society by helping the investigation businesses to follow a custom-built investigative technique in crime analysis and criminal
                      identification as opposed to manually looking the database to analyze criminal activities, and as a result facilitate them in combating crimes.</p>

                    <p>Criminalization is a social phenomenon, which has drastically increased in last few years. In order, to make the job of the investigating agencies easy, use of technology is important. Digital Forensic investigation is a special field
                      of computer forensic in which the scientific procedures and tools will allow the digital evidence to be admissible in a court of law. However there is not a proper guidance or predefined method which is accepted in court of law for
                      investigation .Some tools or techniques provides partial solution to this .Hence the major objective is to implement the digital forensic tool which is based on digital forensic framework proposed[3]. The digital forensic tool will
                      be a automated report generation tool which will be having facility of history keeper and feedback approach. Our digitized approach aids in the improvement of the society by helping the investigating agencies to follow a customized
                      investigative approach in crime analysis and criminal identification rather than manually searching the database to analyze criminal activities, and thus assist them in combating crimes.

                  <h3>MIS for Knowledge Management in the organization</h3>
                  <p>As we know , information is becoming an important corporate resource that must be captured, protected, preserved, and grown. Creating and using knowledge is not limited to information-based companies: it is necessary for all organizations, regardless of industry sector. It's not enough to make good products; companies must make products that are better, less expensive to produce, and more desirable than those of competitors. Using corporate and individual knowledge wisely will help companies do that. In the last few years, companies have downsized and flattened their organizations. Many of the employees who were laid off had been with the company for years. When they walked out the door, they took experience, education, contacts, and information with them. The companies are finding out how important that human resource is to their success. And as companies continue to expand on a global basis and increase their use of technology to connect workers, they have to devise methods of disseminating information quickly to as many people as possible. If an employee in Chicago has experience with a certain production method, it would be silly not to share that information with employees in Singapore so that they don't reinvent the wheel. So as knowledge becomes a central productive and strategic asset, the success of the organization increasingly depends on its ability to gather, produce, maintain, and disseminate knowledge. To understand the concept of knowledge management, think of knowledge as a resource just like buildings, production equipment, product designs, and money. All these resources need to be systematically and actively managed. Bannari Amman Inst.of Technology, 2005.</p>

                  <h3>Network Intrusion and detection Mechanism</h3>
                  <p>The security and value of a computer system is compromised whenever an intrusion occurs. Network-based attacks make it difficult for legitimate users to access various network services by purposely occupying or sabotaging network resources and services. This can be done by sending large amounts of network traffic, exploiting well-known faults in networking services, and by overloading network hosts. Intrusion Detection attempts to detect computer attacks by examining various data records observed in processes on the network and is split into two groups, anomaly detection systems and misuse detection systems. Anomaly detection is an attempt to search for malicious behavior that deviates from established normal patterns. Misuse detection is used to identify intrusions that match known attack scenarios.This paper describe the working of various intrusion detection mechanism and its preventive methods.

                  <h3>Systolic Arrays and Recursion : A new approach for matrix multiplication</h3>
                  <p>Systolic arrays are multidimensional arrays of processing elements. It is an arrangement of processors in an array where data flows synchronously across the array between neighbors, usually with different data flowing in different directions. One of the many applications of systolic array structure is multiplication of matrices. Different types of matrix multiplication, for example band matrix and sparse matrix multiplication are studied. Algorithms with different efficiencies are tested and researched to find the most efficient technique for the same. All these techniques are studied with respect to their implementation using systolic architecture. In this paper we describe the different techniques that use iteration and propose a new and simpler method using recursion.

                  <h3>Neuro-Analytical Hierarchy Process (NAHP)  Approach for Selecting ERP Technologies in a Ongoing Project Settings</h3>
                  <p>This paper provides a solution for ERP software selection & elimination. ERP is a way to integrate data and processes of an organization into a centralized system that aims to have a single software solution where the information needed for decision making is shared across different departments. The selection or elimination of technology is a multi-criteria, multi-attribute, decision making problem, which involves both tangible and intangible factors that can be solved by Neuro-Analytical Hierarchy Process (NAHP). NAHP, which is based on Neural Networks, is a completely new approach towards solving this problem. We make a pair wise comparison of software (ERP) which helps in determining its relative ability to reach the decision goal. Thus NAHP automates the decision making process by justifying 'Why to select one technology?' and 'Why to eliminate one technology?' which helps in benefiting the growth prospects of any organization.</p>

                  <p>Current text messaging protocols over the world allow a rigid limit of 160 characters per SMS, using the default messaging system of the mobile. However this limit is often found to be too less under ordinary circumstances and to communicate effectively, often a concatenated message needs to be sent. This, coupled with exorbitant messaging rates adds to the reduced effectiveness and decrease in potential users of the Short Messaging Service. However, in Zip It Up SMS (ZIUS), we have developed our own algorithm, and been successful in compressing more data into the same message. Now every SMS can carry up to an average-best case of 250 characters, which can bring about a change in standards and prove to be a massive boost to the mobile industry.</p>

                  <h3>Total Productive Maintenance –Accelerating OEE in a Manufacturing Industry leveraging pervasive technologies</h3>
                  <p>Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a people-intensive, preventive maintenance system for maximizing equipment effectiveness in the enterprise. The concept of TPM was originally suggested by Nakajima (1988) who proposed overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) as a metric for evaluating the progress of TPM, which is interpreted as the multiplication of availability, performance and quality. This paper aims to study and investigate the implementation of a TPM to improve the OEE in manufacturing enterprises. In today's industrial scenario huge losses occur in the manufacturing shop floor. These losses are due to operators, maintenance personal, process, tooling problems and non-availability of components in time etc. The quality related waste are of significant importance as they matter the company in terms of time, material and the hard earned reputation of the company. There are also other invisible losses like operating the machines below the rated speed, start up loss, break down of the machines and bottle necks in process. Zero oriented concepts such as zero tolerance for losses, defects, break down and zero accidents are becoming a pre-requisite in the manufacturing and assembly industry. In this situation, a TPM is the answer to resolve the above said problems which helps in benefitting the growth prospects of any organization.</p>

                  <h3>Energy Conservation using Face Detection</h3>
                  <p>Computerized Face Detection, is concerned with the difficult task of converting a video signal of a person to written text. It has several applications like face recognition, simultaneous multiple face processing, biometrics, security, video surveillance, human computer interface, image database management, digital cameras use face detection for autofocus, selecting regions of interest in photo slideshows that use a panand- scale and The Present Paper deals with energy conservation using face detection. Automating the process to a computer requires the use of various image processing techniques. There are various methods that can be used for Face Detection such as Contour tracking methods, Template matching, Controlled background, Model based, Motion based and color based. Basically, the video of the subject are converted into images are further selected manually for processing. However, several factors like poor illumination, movement of face, viewpoint-dependent Physical appearance, Acquisition geometry, Imaging conditions, Compression artifacts makes Face detection difficult. This paper reports an algorithm for conservation of energy using face detection for various devices. The present paper suggests Energy Conservation can be done by Detecting the Face and reducing the brightness of complete image and then adjusting the brightness of the particular area of an image where the face is located using histogram equalization.</p>

                  <h3>Demonstrating Creation of an Empirical Formula from the First Principle: A Case Study in Manufacturing Industries</h3>
                  <p>Small manufacturing industries based on its unit numbers and the number of involved labors , has the potential to play an important role in Indiaâ€™s Economy. Each industry applying the different process of technology acquisition which has the direct impact on cost variable. Each industry has a set of attributes which influences the result of their investments .These success criteria will differ from company to company and hence there is a need to study, to identify and to evaluate such attributes in order to measure the degree of success to be achieved. This paper demonstrates the use of T-distribution model to create an empirical formula from the first principle for Labor cost and the relationship is thus derived between three variables IATC , EATC and LC namely Intrinsic Acquisition Technology Cost and Extrinsic Acquisition Technology Cost and Labor cost respectively which is explained with the data assumed from the survey in manufacturing industry.</p>
