                        <h2>Neuro-Analytical Hierarchy Process (NAHP)  Approach for Selecting ERP Technologies in a Ongoing Project Settings</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: This paper provides a solution for ERP software selection & elimination. ERP is a way to integrate data and processes of an organization into a centralized system that aims to have a single software solution where the information needed for decision making is shared across different departments. The selection or elimination of technology is a multi-criteria, multi-attribute, decision making problem, which involves both tangible and intangible factors that can be solved by Neuro-Analytical Hierarchy Process (NAHP). NAHP, which is based on Neural Networks, is a completely new approach towards solving this problem. We make a pair wise comparison of software (ERP) which helps in determining its relative ability to reach the decision goal. Thus NAHP automates the decision making process by justifying 'Why to select one technology?' and 'Why to eliminate one technology?' which helps in benefiting the growth prospects of any organization.</p>

                        <h2>Zip it Up SMS :- A Path breaking Technology Model in the field of Mobile Messaging</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: Current text messaging protocols over the world allow a rigid limit of 160 characters per SMS, using the default messaging system of the mobile. However this limit is often found to be too less under ordinary circumstances and to communicate effectively, often a concatenated message needs to be sent. This, coupled with exorbitant messaging rates adds to the reduced effectiveness and decrease in potential users of the Short Messaging Service. However, in Zip It Up SMS (ZIUS), we have developed our own algorithm, and been successful in compressing more data into the same message. Now every SMS can carry up to an average-best case of 250 characters, which can bring about a change in standards and prove to be a massive boost to the mobile industry.</p>

                        <h2>Total Productive Maintenance –Accelerating OEE in a Manufacturing Industry leveraging pervasive technologies</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a people-intensive, preventive maintenance system for maximizing equipment effectiveness in the enterprise. The concept of TPM was originally suggested by Nakajima (1988) who proposed overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) as a metric for evaluating the progress of TPM, which is interpreted as the multiplication of availability, performance and quality. This paper aims to study and investigate the implementation of a TPM to improve the OEE in manufacturing enterprises. In today's industrial scenario huge losses occur in the manufacturing shop floor. These losses are due to operators, maintenance personal, process, tooling problems and non-availability of components in time etc. The quality related waste are of significant importance as they matter the company in terms of time, material and the hard earned reputation of the company. There are also other invisible losses like operating the machines below the rated speed, start up loss, break down of the machines and bottle necks in process. Zero oriented concepts such as zero tolerance for losses, defects, break down and zero accidents are becoming a pre-requisite in the manufacturing and assembly industry. In this situation, a TPM is the answer to resolve the above said problems which helps in benefitting the growth prospects of any organization.</p>

                        <h2>Energy Conservation using Face Detection</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: Computerized Face Detection, is concerned with the difficult task of converting a video signal of a person to written text. It has several applications like face recognition, simultaneous multiple face processing, biometrics, security, video surveillance, human computer interface, image database management, digital cameras use face detection for autofocus, selecting regions of interest in photo slideshows that use a panand- scale and The Present Paper deals with energy conservation using face detection. Automating the process to a computer requires the use of various image processing techniques. There are various methods that can be used for Face Detection such as Contour tracking methods, Template matching, Controlled background, Model based, Motion based and color based. Basically, the video of the subject are converted into images are further selected manually for processing. However, several factors like poor illumination, movement of face, viewpoint-dependent Physical appearance, Acquisition geometry, Imaging conditions, Compression artifacts makes Face detection difficult. This paper reports an algorithm for conservation of energy using face detection for various devices. The present paper suggests Energy Conservation can be done by Detecting the Face and reducing the brightness of complete image and then adjusting the brightness of the particular area of an image where the face is located using histogram equalization.</p>

                        <h2>Demonstrating Creation of an Empirical Formula from the First Principle: A Case Study in Manufacturing Industries</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: Small manufacturing industries based on its unit numbers and the number of involved labors , has the potential to play an important role in Indiaâ€™s Economy. Each industry applying the different process of technology acquisition which has the direct impact on cost variable. Each industry has a set of attributes which influences the result of their investments .These success criteria will differ from company to company and hence there is a need to study, to identify and to evaluate such attributes in order to measure the degree of success to be achieved. This paper demonstrates the use of T-distribution model to create an empirical formula from the first principle for Labor cost and the relationship is thus derived between three variables IATC , EATC and LC namely Intrinsic Acquisition Technology Cost and Extrinsic Acquisition Technology Cost and Labor cost respectively which is explained with the data assumed from the survey in manufacturing industry.</p>

                        <h2>MIS for Knowledge Management in the organization</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: As we know , information is becoming an important corporate resource that must be captured, protected, preserved, and grown. Creating and using knowledge is not limited to information-based companies: it is necessary for all organizations, regardless of industry sector. It's not enough to make good products; companies must make products that are better, less expensive to produce, and more desirable than those of competitors. Using corporate and individual knowledge wisely will help companies do that. In the last few years, companies have downsized and flattened their organizations. Many of the employees who were laid off had been with the company for years. When they walked out the door, they took experience, education, contacts, and information with them. The companies are finding out how important that human resource is to their success. And as companies continue to expand on a global basis and increase their use of technology to connect workers, they have to devise methods of disseminating information quickly to as many people as possible. If an employee in Chicago has experience with a certain production method, it would be silly not to share that information with employees in Singapore so that they don't reinvent the wheel. So as knowledge becomes a central productive and strategic asset, the success of the organization increasingly depends on its ability to gather, produce, maintain, and disseminate knowledge. To understand the concept of knowledge management, think of knowledge as a resource just like buildings, production equipment, product designs, and money. All these resources need to be systematically and actively managed. Bannari Amman Inst.of Technology, 2005.</p>

                        <h2>Network Intrusion and detection Mechanism</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: The security and value of a computer system is compromised whenever an intrusion occurs. Network-based attacks make it difficult for legitimate users to access various network services by purposely occupying or sabotaging network resources and services. This can be done by sending large amounts of network traffic, exploiting well-known faults in networking services, and by overloading network hosts. Intrusion Detection attempts to detect computer attacks by examining various data records observed in processes on the network and is split into two groups, anomaly detection systems and misuse detection systems. Anomaly detection is an attempt to search for malicious behavior that deviates from established normal patterns. Misuse detection is used to identify intrusions that match known attack scenarios.This paper describe the working of various intrusion detection mechanism and its preventive methods.

                        <h2>Systolic Arrays and Recursion : A new approach for matrix multiplication</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: Systolic arrays are multidimensional arrays of processing elements. It is an arrangement of processors in an array where data flows synchronously across the array between neighbors, usually with different data flowing in different directions. One of the many applications of systolic array structure is multiplication of matrices. Different types of matrix multiplication, for example band matrix and sparse matrix multiplication are studied. Algorithms with different efficiencies are tested and researched to find the most efficient technique for the same. All these techniques are studied with respect to their implementation using systolic architecture. In this paper we describe the different techniques that use iteration and propose a new and simpler method using recursion.
