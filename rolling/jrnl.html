                        <h2>Total productive Maintenance : A case study in Manufacturing Industry</h2>
                        <p >Abstract : Total productive maintenance (TPM) is a people-intensive, preventive maintenance system for maximizing equipment effectiveness in the enterprise. The concept of TPM was originally suggested by Nakajima (1988) who proposed overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) as a metric for evaluating the progress of TPM, which is interpreted as the multiplication of availability, performance and quality. This paper aims to study and investigate the implementation of TPM to improve the OEE of the bull gear shop plant in manufacturing enterprises. In todayâ€™s industrial scenario huge losses occur in the manufacturing shop floor. These losses are due to operators, maintenance personal, process, tooling problems and non-availability of components in time etc. The quality related wastes are of significant importance as they matter the company in terms of time, material and the hard earned reputation of the company. There are also other invisible losses like operating the machines below the rated speed, start up loss, break down of the machines and bottle necks in process. Zero oriented concepts such as zero tolerance for losses, defects, break down and zero accidents are becoming a pre-requisite in the manufacturing and assembly industry. In this situation, a TPM is the answer to resolve the above said problems which helps in benefitting the growth prospects of any organization.

                        <h2>Multi-attribute and Multi-criteria Decision Making Model for technology selection using fuzzy logic</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: The problem of identification and elimination of useful technology is a multi-attribute, multi-valued problem which involves both tangible and intangible factors. To select the best useful technology that achieves most of the company requirements ,it is essential to use an appropriate selection approach that takes into consideration the different. quantitative and qualitative parameters of industry objectives and technology benefits. In this paper,FMCDM (Fuzzy-based MultAttribute and Multi-criteria decision Method ) is described and explained .

                        <h2>Incidence Handling & Response System</h2>
                        <p >Abstract:A computer network can be attacked in a number of ways. The security-related threats have become not only numerous but also diverse and they may also come in the form of blended attacks. it becomes difficult for any security system to block all types of attacks. this gives rise to the need of an incidence handling capability which is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited and restoring the computing services. incidence response has always been an important aspect of information security but it is often overlooked by security administrators. in this paper, we propose an automated system which will handle the security threats and make the computer network capable enough to withstand any kind of attack. we also present the state-of-the-art technology in computer, network and software which is required to build such a system.

                        <h2>Algorithm to access Office Files on Mobile Phones.</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: Almost all mobile phones available in the market support the programming language Java i.e. J2ME, but majority of these phones do not support the following file formats - .doc, .docx, .ppt and .rtf. These phones allow only .txt files to be viewed. Presently there is no software that allows java enabled phones to view these files. So users have to convert these files to .txt and in the case of .ppt, they have to convert it into an image. Since these files are important for many users, this causes a lot of inconvenience to them. In this paper we propose a â€˜Mobile Officeâ€™ application which will make it possible for all java enabled mobile phone users to view the above mentioned files. Moreover, this will opiate the need to convert a .doc, .docx or .rtf file to .txt to be able to view them on the phone. We also describe the approach about how the above file formats can be accessed. This approach will enable these files to be accessed in low end java enabled devices with relative ease.

                        <h2>ANFIS based Spam Filtering Model for Social Networking Websites.</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: Spam is flooding the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. There are various types of spam such as email spam, forum spam, online classified ads spam, attachment spam, social networking spam etc. For the purpose of this paper, we would like to concentrate more on social networking spam (SNS). SNS is when unwanted messages or posts are sent to people in bulk, or when a single click of a seemingly harmless link reposts the link on other profiles, thus spreading the spam like a virus. We plan to use an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that incorporates the advantages of both the neural networking concepts and fuzzy logic to identify the spam messages on such websites.</p>

                        <h2>Smartcard based Android Application for Public Transport Ticketing System.</h2>
                        <p >Abstract: The large amount of growth in India's population has increased the demand on the transport systems. In the areas of public transport, it has become essential to consider effective technologies that will ease the system of transport. This paper presents the design of a public transport ticketing system that harnesses the functionality of the existing electronic smart cards into an Android application. This application aims to relate the Man Machine Interaction (MMI) principles of functionality, usability, simplicity, visibility, affordance and consistency for enhancing the experience of ticketing for the public transport commuters in India.
